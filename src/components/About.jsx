          Iâ€™m Siddharth Phadkeâ€”a coder by profession, gamer by passion, and cook
          by necessity! With 6+ years in frontend development (ReactJS, React
          Native, NextJS), Iâ€™ve built high-performance web apps for companies
          like CVS Pharmacy and Apple. I love optimizing code as much as I love
          optimizing my gaming strategies!
        </li>

        <li className="about-me">
          When Iâ€™m not crafting sleek UIs, youâ€™ll find me conquering virtual
          worlds or experimenting in the kitchen (because debugging and cooking
          require the same patience). With a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science and a
          research paper on IoT, Iâ€™m always up for learning, coding, and
          creating something amazing! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥
